                    Clark</a>: "Pervasive Semantic Annotation of Biomedical Literature using Domeo"</b>
            <br>
            <i>Abstract</i>: Despite the fact that we now have access to almost all peer reviewed publications on the Web,
            these publications appear to us in a linear form which is a replica of print journals. At the same time there
            are increasingly attractive opportunities to surface data and concepts directly on the Web, using semantic
            organization. This talk will discuss how - for biomedical researchers - the Web of Documents and the Web of Data
            / Concepts can be bridged and integrated, using the Domeo Web Annotation Toolkit and the Annotation Ontology
            (AO). Domeo and AO can be used to annotate any HTML document whether or not it is under update control of the
            user. The AO annotation can be selectively shared and exchanged and is orthogonal to any specific biomedical
            domain ontology. We believe this approach will be extremely useful in drug discovery to break down information
            silos, increase information awareness and sharing, and integrate terminologies and data with documents and text,
            both public and private. We will discuss applications we are currently developing in collaboration with a major
            pharma.

            <br>
            <i>Abstract</i>: The growing size of the scientific literature has led to a number of attempts to automatically
            extract entities and relationships from scientific papers, and then to populate databases with this extracted
            information. In my group we have been exploring techniques for using this sort of extracted information for
            specific tasks, including "bootstrapping" to improve the coverage of an extraction system, retrieval tasks
            involving the scientific literature, and modeling protein-protein interaction data. This joint work with Ramnath

                University of Colorado - Denver: "The First Artificial Mind Will Think About Molecular Biomedicine"</b>
            <br>
            <i>Abstract</i>: Biomedicine, particularly as informed by genome-scale instrumentation, provides a unique domain
            for artificial intelligence and discovery informatics research. There are at least three phenomena that
            contribute to its status as a good domain for AI. First, there are several important characteristics of the
            domain, including (a) the knowledge-based (rather than law-like) nature of scientific explanation in
            biomedicine, (b) the modest role that common sense knowledge plays in biological reasoning, and (c) the
            possibility of embodiment of programs in the context of powerful automated experimental instrumentation. Second,
            there are a variety of highly significant resources available to researchers developing AI systems, including
            (a) extensive, continuously expanding, publicly available, and incompletely analyzed dataset of high value; (b)
            carefully constructed ontological resources constructed and maintained by diverse communities of experts, and
            (c) many specific use cases that offer clearly defined and highly significant problems that AI techniques have
            high potential to address. Finally, there is an extensive community of biomedical researchers and practitioners
            highly motivated to exploit and interact with computational systems that increase the quality, speed or ease of
            their scientific insights. The power of this combination of eager user community, valuable existing resources
            and appropriate domain characteristics is already clear from existing work in biomedical discovery informatics,
            but, as this talk will try to argue, the future is even brighter.

                participants"</b>
            <br>
            <i>Abstract</i>: Citizen science in the form of crowdsourcing has to proved to be an effective response to the
            growing size of scientific datasets. This talk will present strategies and results from the Zooniverse, a
            collection of projects which have enabled more than 500,000 people to help scientists classify galaxies,
            discover planets, sort through whale songs and even transcribe ancient papyri. As datasets continue to grow,
            these projects must adapt, and the talk will concentrate on methods which move beyond the current naive random
            task assignment model. A dynamic bayesian classification of volunteers, applied to a supernova hunting project,
            was able to achieve much greater efficiency in classification, while dividing classifiers into communities based
            on their ability and behaviour. Future development of such systems will need to incorporate such analysis into
            their methodology, allowing user behaviour to guide task allocation, training and perhaps even collaboration.

                University: "The Robotic Scientist: Distilling Natural Laws from Experimental Data, from particle physics to
                computational biology"</b>
            <br>
            <i>Abstract</i>: Can machines discover scientific laws automatically? For centuries, scientists have attempted
            to identify and document analytical laws that underlie physical phenomena in nature. Despite the prevalence of
            computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation.
            This talk will outline a series of recent research projects, starting with self-reflecting robotic systems, and
            ending with machines that can formulate hypotheses, design experiments, and interpret the results, to discover
            new scientific laws. While the computer can discover new laws, will we still understand them? Our ability to
            have insight into science may not keep pace with the rate and complexity of automatically-generated discoveries.
            Are we entering a post-singularity scientific age, where computers not only discover new science, but now also
            need to find ways to explain it in a way that humans can understand? We will see examples from psychology to
            cosmology, from classical physics to modern physics, from big science to small science.

            <br>
            <i>Abstract</i>: Machine learning has made tremendous progress over the past several decades. It has become one
            of today’s most important technologies for discovery and its future impact is likely to grow rapidly for the
            foreseeable future. However, to use the powerful capabilities offered by machine learning, domain experts
            typically need to find a collaborator who is a highly trained computer scientist possessing substantial
            experience with machine learning. This greatly limits the impact of this powerful technology. We are addressing
            the important challenge of reducing the barrier to entry for using machine learning by allowing domain experts
            to more directly communicate their expertise to machine learning algorithms. Providing such domain expertise in
            an effective manner promises to democratize machine learning, more <a

            spreading this valuable technology to tasks where it can have a substantial impact. We are focusing on allowing
            domain experts to do more than providing (a) the features used to describe examples and (b) the desired outputs
            for training examples. We are creating learning algorithms that accept naturally expressed 'advice' whenever a
            domain expert has some knowledge that he or she wishes to provide. The human-provided advice need not be 100%
            correct since our learning algorithms are robust in the presence of imperfect advice.
