  <h2>Workshop Description</h2>
  <p>The synergies between advances in computing and advances in science open the doors to exciting research agendas in computer science. Scientific questions have motivated computer science research in many areas including distributed sensor networks, high-end computing, distributed systems, scalable databases, statistical and data mining algorithms, computer networks and the web itself.  Scientists have now the means to collect and process unprecedented amounts of data to understand phenomena that could not be studied before, from climate change to social networks to phylogenetics.

  </p><p>In order to address the ambitious research agenda put forward by many science disciplines, many challenges must be addressed in the areas of information sciences, intelligent systems, and human-computer interaction. Data modeling and integration still require large investments of scientist time and effort.  The scientific literature grows so quickly in many areas that it becomes unmanageable for scientists.  Many aspects of the scientific discovery process are often largely manual and could be automated, improved, or made more efficient.  Better interfaces for collaboration, visualization, and understanding would significantly improve scientific practice.
  At the same time, recent research in information and intelligent systems has opened up new opportunities for scientific discovery.   Social computing has been successfully demonstrated as a novel approach to scientific discoveries.  Social robotics is an emerging area that presents new opportunities to redesign data collection.  The Semantic Web offers radically new paradigms for data publication and sharing.

  </p><p><b>The goal of this workshop is to investigate the opportunities that scientific discoveries present to information sciences and intelligent systems as a new area of research called discovery informatics.</b>

  </p><p>Possible themes in discovery informatics for discussion at the workshop include:

  </p><ul>
  <li><b>Efficient experimentation and discovery processes</b>:  Scientific discovery processes involve many steps that are often managed or executed manually.  While a lot of research has been devoted to managing complex data analysis processes in distributed resources for large-scale execution, many aspects of the management of those processes have been neglected, such as:  How can scientists formulate data analysis workflows efficiently?  How can systems best support and document the repeated hypothesis-experiment-test cycle that leads to discoveries?  What kinds of intelligent reasoning can be brought to bear in the experimentation process?  What roles can robots play in experimental processes?  What new scientific discoveries could be enabled by robots?  How can collaborative and cross-disciplinary process formulation be facilitated?  How can discovery processes be shared, reused, and efficiently adapted to new questions?  Can scientific processes be easily reproducible, repeatable, and repurposed?  Is it possible to set formal guarantees that a dataset has been fully exploited and no opportunities for discoveries remain?  Can we quantify the cost of a scientific question in terms of resources to explore the hypothesis space?

  </li><li><b>Practical issues in learning models from science data</b>: Many discoveries are the result of applying data mining and machine learning techniques to experimental data.  In recent years, there has been a lot of research on data-intensive computing and on novel machine learning algorithms.  However, many key aspects of learning from data remain largely open research questions, such as: What kind of assistance can be provided to scientists to help them formulate hypotheses and then create experiments to test them with data?  How can hypotheses be linked to data needs and therefore be used to control data collection instruments?  What are appropriate methodologies to address data cleaning and preparation?  What feature selection techniques are appropriate for given kinds of data or for a given question posed by a scientist?  How can human ideas and insight be combined with machine learning algorithms?  How could a system highlight what is unusual about a dataset that grants further investigation?  How can insightful visualizations become commonplace?

  </li><li><b>Social computing for science</b>: The raise of the social web has uncovered social computing as a completely new approach to discoveries.  From protein folding to proving theorems, anyone with a little training can become a participant and even contribute to novel discoveries.  This is a very recent area that is still highly exploratory and with many open research questions: What scientific tasks are amenable to social computing approaches?  How can tasks be organized piecemeal to enable many contributors to understand what is expected of them?  How can different contributor roles be defined and assigned to optimize the formulation of scientific tasks?  How can we facilitate the development of reusable software infrastructure for social computing in science?  How can we develop social computing approaches that enable K-12 students to take more active roles in scientific discoveries as a novel way to integrate research and education?

  </li></ul>

  <p>These themes, as well as other salient themes that may arise from discussions at the meeting, will be articulated in detail in the final workshop report outlining the challenges and opportunities in discovery informatics.
